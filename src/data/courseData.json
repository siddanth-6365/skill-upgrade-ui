It offers various service models such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), allowing users to access resources on-demand without the need for managing physical hardware. Deployment models include public, private, and hybrid clouds, each offering different levels of control and customization. Cloud computing provides benefits such as scalability, cost-efficiency, flexibility, and accessibility, but also presents challenges related to security, reliability, and vendor lock-in. Overall, it revolutionizes IT infrastructure by enabling organizations to efficiently utilize resources and focus on innovation and business growth.",
